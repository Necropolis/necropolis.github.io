### The Necropolis  
This is where old code goes to die. You might want to put code here if:

* You aren't working on it any more
* You don't want to support it any more
* You don't want to delete it - there might be something worthwhile in there somewhere!
* You don't want it cluttering up your Github account

There are reasons to want to drive the nails into the coffin and ship the old horse off to the undertaker.

* Maybe you're preparing for a job interview, and you don't want old and busted stuff in front your your employer-to-be's face?
* Perhaps you're having difficulty finding your active projects in the list of old stuff?
* People are bugging you about some old and busted code, and you need to send a message that "I'm not doing this any more!"

Whatever the case, the code is dead, and you'd rather it just lie in a hole and deprecate. If so, transfer ownership to `Necropolis`, and it'll be like it never happened - un-cluttering your world and giving you sweet clarity! Like a shaft of light piercing the dull gray stormclouds over the graveyard! Some days burying things can be so therapeutic! Don't you think?
