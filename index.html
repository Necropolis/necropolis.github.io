        <h3>The Necropolis</h3>

<p>This is where old code goes to die. You might want to put code here if:</p>

<ul>
<li>You aren't working on it any more</li>
<li>You don't want to support it any more</li>
<li>You don't want to delete it - there might be something worthwhile in there somewhere!</li>
<li>You don't want it cluttering up your Github account</li>
</ul><p>There are reasons to want to drive the nails into the coffin and ship the old horse off to the undertaker.</p>

<ul>
<li>Maybe you're preparing for a job interview, and you don't want old and busted stuff in front your your employer-to-be's face?</li>
<li>Perhaps you're having difficulty finding your active projects in the list of old stuff?</li>
<li>People are bugging you about some old and busted code, and you need to send a message that "I'm not doing this any more!"</li>
</ul><p>Whatever the case, the code is dead, and you'd rather it just lie in a hole and deprecate. If so, transfer ownership to <code>Necropolis</code>, and it'll be like it never happened - un-cluttering your world and giving you sweet clarity! Like a shaft of light piercing the dull gray stormclouds over the graveyard! Some days burying things can be so therapeutic! Don't you think?</p>
